Let AI and cloud vendors know what they can pay Andrew to review their products

## ChatGPT Engineer Feedback
- I wish I could one press and have screenshots of the outputed website for documentation history
- I want to instead update golden technical doc and dump it in instead of tweaking the page through multi-convo because I want to capture all documentation for my technical doc. I want my prompting to be derminstic (replicable via steps)
- I want to review the code before I sync to my repo (otherwise I can't provide it feedback until it synced)
- I don't know if it it publishes the changes to the repo after each change.
- If it did, it would be nice if it was via a PR so I can review
- I don't know my usage when I'm using the app. I wish this was clear.
